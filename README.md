# MyWebsite
#### I was thinking about building something and had a few ideas and well, I would assume that everybody needs a personal website, so I will build it first.
## Technologies that I will use:
*I was thinking about using something that will upgrade my skills in some perspective, so I decided on this stack*

#### For the Back-End
- Node.js with Express.js - just because I can.
- MongoDB - I'm tired of Relation databases, so will be using it.
- Docker - just want to see thing differently from the perspective of hosting.
- AWS EC2 - for hosting.
#### For the Front-End
- HTML5, CSS3 - I would assume that I cannot use something different to build the layout
- React.js - Yes, I know, I don't know and even don't understand it, so It will be fun :)
